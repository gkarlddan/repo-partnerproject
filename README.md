## Nicholas Slack

- I am from London, Ontario and have never lived anywhere else.
- I have a few different hobbies. I play Warhammer 40k and have multiple different armies that I have painted. I also play Magic the Gathering, I play Commander most of the time and have multiple decks. Recently I have learned that I like video editing and have started a youtube channel called Lore and Lascannons. I also like video games, I have been playing Hollow Knight: Silksong recently. 
- This is my second course that I am taking at Fanshawe, the first one that I took was the Web Development and Internet Applications course. I am in this course because it didnt cover design very much and I decided that it would be better to know that aspect as well.
