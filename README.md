## James Kuebler

1. My name is James Kuebler. I currently live in Middlesex Centre, Ontario and prior to that, I lived in Guelph (my birthplace) and later Cambridge.
2. My hobbies include building Lego sets which I then put on display, One of my favourites is a replica of the Nintendo Entertainment System. I also enjoy listening to music, mainly general throwbacks, European dance hits with a bit of country music, modern contemporary hit songs and the Splatoon soundtrack mixed in as well. I also do video-editing as a hobby and pasttime as well, I'm a YouTuber who makes videos of video games and also streams as well. Also, I enjoy video games, primarily from Nintendo, but I also enjoy some third-party and indie games as well. My final hobby is travelling and learning about new places around the world and immersing myself in their cultures.
3. This is my second program at Fanshawe College. I was previously in the Tourism program for the last two years and the coolest thing was a 7-night Soutern Caribbean cruise aboard Royal Caribbean's MS Rhapsody of the Seas
